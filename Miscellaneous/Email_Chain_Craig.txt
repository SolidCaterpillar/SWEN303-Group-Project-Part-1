Kia ora Z’Arn,

If you just do Figma that will be fine. Right there is no need to use Flutter but if you want to use that tool then that is fine. Happy for you to explore other technologies.

Craig

To do this, we feel as though using a UI framework such as Flutter would be helpful for this task. We aren't interested in designing a back-end, just the tools for designing a UI.
