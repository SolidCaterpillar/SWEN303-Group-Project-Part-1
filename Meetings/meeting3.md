- [ ] Finish background

## Overall

**Inconsistent Iconography and Layout:**

Confusion caused by inconsistent icons and lack of text labels, leading to difficulties in understanding the functionality.

**System Feedback and Error Prevention:**

Absence of feedback mechanisms like confirmation dialogs or success notifications, coupled with insufficient error prevention features.

**Information Overload and Clarity:**

Interfaces are overcrowded, lacking clear hierarchy or organization, which contributes to cognitive overload and confusion.

## Z'arn's Evaluation:

**Heuristics:**

- different options for alert: bar at bottom, alert modal, etc

**Cognitive:**

- Make a clear way to view transactions

**Main issues:**

- System feedback
- Lack of notifications
- lack of iconography

## Risheet's Evaluation:

**Heuristics:**

- Needed more active iconography
- More focus on a more intuitive hierarchy, avoid information overload.
- Scrolling could be more obvious
- With real payments, needs more user control and freedom

- Liked the responsiveness

**Cognitive:**

- Too crowded
- Hard to message 

 **Main Issues:**
 
- More error prevention needed.
- Stronger information hierarchy and spacing.

## Mazen's Evaluation:

**Heuristics:**

- **Changing icons to avoid confusion** (house button for manage flat)
- Avoid trapping the user on a page (keep home/settings etc at the top on all pages)
- Provide options to navigate past transactions by year, not just month
- Clearer indication of what transactions are expenses/incomes? (colours or plus/minus symbols)
- **Consistency** in whether things are centred or left-aligned.

**Cognitive:**

- Unclear of positioning of icons
- Can't rely on just icons (up for interpretation) 
	- prefer a combination of text and icons

## Hamish's Evaluation:

**Heuristic:**

- Lack of confirmation dialog
- Unneeded 'April Budget' at top (doesn't need on settings)
- Confusing icons 
- No way of removing/changing existing transactions and categories
- Consistency on styling (between categories and savings goal)
- Don't just have percentages, also include dollar amount
- duplicate info*

**Cognitive:**

_Note, there were issues with the fact that only scenarios were shown_

- Debbie got confused finding the see "more insights button", wanted to go expense page.

## Alvien's Evaluation:

**Heuristic:**

- Unclear what charts are for
- Avoid overcrowding, remember you can scroll to see more content
- Avoid getting trapped. Make sure all pages have a way to exit it (have a back button on manage flat page)
- Not sure what today/weekly/monthly buttons do at top. Make clear it only affects the chart, and not the expenses below it
	- Maybe put buttons and chart in some card, so they're separated from expenses?

**Cognitive:**

- Confusion at looking at expenses
- Confusion when something on the nav bar went into a form
- Small boxes were a problem
- Issues with just a plus button

## Ricky's Evaluation

**Heuristic:**

- Misc should be at bottom of categories, not middle
- Consistency: top bar layout changes regularly, spacing changes between pages
- No error prevention for adding transactions
- Unintuitive scanning for adding split payment - keep form contents in one column
- Indicate required fields

**Cognitive:**

- Unclear when selecting category when creating expense - didn't know you also needed to push done
- Confirmation modal - showing transaction added successfully would be helpful
- Making clear what's a button (had to click pie graph)
- Change flatmates button, confusing what's
