# SWEN303 Assingment

## Goals:

- [ ] Lofi finalise
- [x] Setup flutter
- [ ] Couple people finish figma designs

> Comments comments on figma**

## Expense Page

My favourite Expenses design is 1, but I think it would look nicer with taller statements and a smaller vertical margin like 4

## To-do

> **Git repo**: Use branches for **features** (ie: Hamburger menu widget, single statement widget)

1. get used to flutter - `flutter run`, try changing the `main.dart`
2. Figure out Flutter project structure
3. Comment on designs
4. Finish lofi using comments
