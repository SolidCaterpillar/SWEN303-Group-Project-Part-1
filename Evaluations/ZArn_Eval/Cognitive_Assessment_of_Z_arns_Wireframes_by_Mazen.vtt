WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.800
All right. You have been given Zahn's presentation. Your first task is to switch the flat and check

00:08.800 --> 00:15.200
expenses. Your persona is Abby Jones, that is to say, someone who is 25 years old, a history

00:15.200 --> 00:22.880
PhD student broke. She, her impatient, quick, likes bright colors and good design. Okay.

00:23.360 --> 00:30.080
Yes. Please begin. Please elaborate on what you are, you know, what your thoughts are when

00:30.080 --> 00:36.880
you're reading this and how you're going to achieve your goal. This frame is colorful. Okay. I can see

00:36.880 --> 00:42.320
like, there's several buttons that are easy to click. Yep. Focus on the task that you need to

00:42.320 --> 00:49.440
accomplish and the subtask that you need to accomplish. So to change a flat, I will

00:53.680 --> 00:59.040
I will probably click my profile picture. Okay.

01:02.160 --> 01:07.280
That I say that. I don't have to say whether that's okay. Now I just say you do it and then just

01:07.280 --> 01:16.800
change slide. Okay. So change slide. Next slide. Oh, so good. Just keep going.

01:17.680 --> 01:23.840
Okay. Okay. Just keep talking about what you see. Yep. So keep talking about what you see.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.880
Well, I see the flatmate is, is an address location.

01:32.880 --> 01:37.840
So to, so I'm assuming to click any new flatmate, I had to click one of the address.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.600
Okay. Yep.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.680
Okay. Your next task is to view payments and get more detail on broadband.

01:53.440 --> 02:05.120
Okay. To view a payment, I probably click on the, the pie chart to view a payments.

02:08.800 --> 02:17.280
Uh, go ahead. So not quite. You would need to hover over the broadband because payments are

02:17.280 --> 02:29.600
right here. Okay. So now you're hovering over broadband. What do you want to do to view the

02:29.600 --> 02:33.760
broadband? Click it. Click it. Well, you're kind of already looking at, if you're viewing the

02:33.840 --> 02:40.560
broadband here. So this is kind of a non-task, if you will, where it's the end task of looking at

02:40.560 --> 02:47.200
the broadband now. So there's no action to take here. Okay. All right. Before you continue.

02:51.440 --> 02:57.200
All right. Your second task is adding an expense and your persona is Bob Dylan.

02:57.200 --> 03:04.400
Bob Dylan is a first year Canterbury student. He's a spoiled child, uh, irresponsibly rich,

03:04.400 --> 03:12.080
19 years old. He, him, uh, loves a crypto guy. He's a finance bro. He loves to party,

03:12.080 --> 03:18.400
drink, et cetera. Uh, he's pretty, he's pretty tech literate, lots of expenses, et cetera.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.440
All right. So your task is to add an expense. Please begin. Okay.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.400
All right. Can you please explain what you see? And sorry, what, how you're, what your thoughts

03:30.400 --> 03:36.240
are on completing your task of adding an expense? Well, my fault is, uh, I can see, this is a home

03:36.240 --> 03:43.120
page where I can see the summarize of my expense and my friend mates and upcoming payments.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.640
Hi. Sorry. What, uh, I wasn't paying attention. Why I see is a home page where I can see this

03:51.360 --> 03:55.360
summary of my expense, the flatmates and upcoming payments.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.040
Okay. And what do you think you're going to have to do to, um, to navigate to expenses,

03:59.040 --> 04:04.240
which is the sum task for this page? Uh, I can see a expense tab right here. So I'm assuming

04:04.240 --> 04:09.920
I had a click on it. Okay. Uh, before you just continue, uh, yes, continue.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.760
Continue. What do you see now? And what, what are you trying to accomplish and how are you

04:17.760 --> 04:27.920
going to accomplish it? What I can see is a, uh, list of current, uh, expenses to pay. Okay.

04:29.200 --> 04:33.840
And to a new expense, I'm assuming I had to click the button and new buttons. Okay.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.080
Please go ahead and press that button.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.520
What do you see now? What would you like to do? How are you going to see, uh,

04:43.520 --> 04:46.800
it feel well formed for creating a new expense. Okay.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.560
So I had to enter the expense name, the price, and why speak, but we did.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.080
Okay. And then date. And then what would you do? And I click the button created.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.440
And then you'd click the create button. Yep. Okay. Please do so.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.280
Can you please explain what you see right here?

05:09.280 --> 05:21.200
I see, uh, the expense I created is below under the power, which is a sky bill.

05:23.680 --> 05:30.720
Okay. Is that, are you sure that's the expense you created? Yep. Good. All right. Can you do

05:30.720 --> 05:37.520
you know next, please? All right. Your third task for Zahn's, uh, presentation or Zahn's, uh,

05:38.480 --> 05:46.640
uh, wireframes is to notify a flatmate of an expense. Your persona is John Baker. John Baker is

05:46.640 --> 05:53.040
cautious, uh, especially after his terrible, terrible hand accident, which, um, made him lose

05:53.040 --> 05:59.040
his right hand. So for this exercise, I would like you to not use your right hand. Uh, I would like

05:59.040 --> 06:06.400
you to think in the mind of John Baker as being 40 plus. He thinks about the fine details. However,

06:06.400 --> 06:12.800
he's pretty tech literate. Uh, he's a senior foreman and, uh, yeah, that's, that's the personality

06:12.800 --> 06:20.320
you are to add notify a flatmate of an expense. Please begin. Thank you. Please elaborate on

06:20.320 --> 06:24.880
what you see and what you are trying to accomplish and how you will accomplish it.

06:25.840 --> 06:35.760
So I can see, uh, an expense, um, but there's three expense, uh, which is rent. So that is the

06:35.760 --> 06:43.040
broadband and power. Please speak up. I can see a three expense rent broadband and power.

06:44.400 --> 06:50.960
Okay. And what is the goal you're trying to accomplish here? The goal is to open up the expense.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.200
Okay. Could you please do that for me? What do you think you would do to do that?

06:56.000 --> 07:03.760
Uh, I will click rent because look big to me. Okay. Please click on rent as you would.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.720
Okay. What do you see and what are you trying to do and how will you do it?

07:12.720 --> 07:27.440
Um, so, uh, always, I see a date for nightly. I see me, uh, that 600, I'm assuming $300.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.120
Okay. So you would say that's not clear what the 600 is?

07:31.120 --> 07:32.320
Yeah. From the home screen.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.240
Or no, you know it's dollars. Yeah.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.320
Yeah. It's a dollar. What does it mean?

07:37.280 --> 07:40.880
Uh, it means I have to pay $600.

07:40.880 --> 07:46.640
Okay. And so what do you, how will you accomplish your goal from here?

07:48.320 --> 07:49.360
Yes. Uh,

07:52.080 --> 07:54.560

08:03.600 --> 08:08.080
clicking the bell icon on Steve or Sam. Okay. Please do it. Please go ahead and next slide.

08:11.200 --> 08:18.240
