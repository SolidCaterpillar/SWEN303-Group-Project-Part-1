# Cognitive Evaluation

> For Alvien's Wireframes (evaluated by Hamish and user tested by Z'arn)

- **Enhance Navigation Clarity**: Increase the visibility and intuitiveness of navigation elements. Ensure that users can easily locate and understand the purpose of buttons and commands, especially in the navigation bar.

- **Improve Visual Cues and Hierarchy**: Establish a clear visual hierarchy to guide the user's eye through tasks. Label elements clearly and distinctly to prevent confusion about their functions.

- **Align Interface with User Expectations**: Adjust the interface to meet user expectations, such as ensuring that *the 'weekly expenses' button displays the correct information* without unexpected redirects.

- **Simplify User Interactions**: Streamline user interactions by reducing the steps needed to perform tasks. For instance, *replacing a 'plus' button with a 'done' button* where appropriate can enhance user understanding and satisfaction.

- **Refine Visual Design of Interactive Elements**: Enhance the design and layout of forms and interactive elements. Make sure that buttons and dropdowns are easy to distinguish and interact with, avoiding issues like *small and indistinct yes/no buttons*.

- **Address Unexpected Elements in User Flow**: Minimize surprises in user interactions, such as *unexpected forms appearing immediately after a button press from the nav bar*. This will help create a smoother user experience.

Yeah, okay, cool. We're gonna recording we that's Yeah, so just getting started. So I'm looking at this first user task so I will be looking at the expenses for weekly and stats. Okay, so let's have a look. So I'm just looking at weekly expenses. struggling to find where exactly. Okay, yeah, near the top. I was looking near the bottom for some reason. Yeah, but yeah, I can see that there's a small nav bar at the top where I can change weekly expenses, so I'll tap that. Oh. Okay, now I guess I will. Now go have a look at stats page. That makes fairly good sense. I'll just tap that page. Make sense? Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now it makes a bit more sense in the sense that now I understand that I need to go to the stats page and then change it to weekly hopefully. So now I'll just go to the weekly and tap that hopefully for weekly expenses. Okay, okay. Go through the questions. First. You want to pause Yes.

## Task Evaluation

The evaluation of the "View Weekly Expenses" task highlights several usability issues that could hinder user experience. From the user task transcription and frame analysis, it's clear that the interface lacks intuitive navigation cues. Users initially struggle to locate the command for viewing weekly expenses, which suggests that the navigation bar and its elements are not optimally positioned or adequately highlighted. The confusion about needing to click on the stats button to access weekly expenses indicates a disconnect between user expectations and the actual flow of the interface. This mismatch is further emphasized by the user's expectation that selecting 'weekly' from the top menu would directly show weekly expenses, but instead, it defaults to 'today'. These findings suggest a need for a more coherent information architecture and clearer visual cues to improve navigability and meet user expectations more effectively.

Okay, yeah, so starting the second task, which will be adding a new expense. Okay, so yeah, just looking at this, it makes fairly good sense that I just need to tap the Add Expense button, which I'll do. And yeah, I got presented with a weird well of weird form. But I wasn't expecting it to be a form already. But yeah, I'll just fill in the relevant details. Looking through it. I can see I've got dropdowns and all that sort of stuff. I'm a bit worried about the structuring of the form. Because it makes no sense that for example, all of us isn't like a weird box shape, when, for example, it doesn't follow. Intuitive layering, but yeah, I noticed that once I will fill this out, I'll just press plus confirm expense. Yeah, it does look a bit small, but I can press yes. Yeah, I also noticed that I couldn't really differentiate between no and yes, initially, but it was fairly straightforward otherwise. And yeah, I like the new success, but it seems the New Expense seems good.
```

## Task Evaluation

In the "Add New Expense" task, while users can form the goal and locate the add expense button without much difficulty, the immediate transition to a form was unexpected and led to a moment of confusion. The user's feedback about the structure of the form not following intuitive layering and the difficulty in differentiating between 'yes' and 'no' options points to a need for better visual hierarchy and clarity in button designs. The task showed that while the primary functions were accessible, the detailed execution lacked finesse, which could affect user satisfaction and error rates. The feedback provided is crucial for refining UI elements to ensure that they not only meet functional needs but also align with user expectations for a smooth and intuitive interaction.

Okay, so yeah, now my new task is to add a new flatmate. So I will just have a look at that. Okay, just kind of identifying that. Yeah, I see that there's no real major instructors relating to it. So I will press the hamburger menu. Okay, so Oh man. Yeah. Okay, seeing that I can clearly see flatmates, console tap flash. That made intuitive sense. Now I'm on this menu, I can identify that it says, Add New flatmate. That makes sense as well really. And yeah, now I'm presented with a form which makes sense I can see their name preferred name, I can add all of that stuff and then press the plus at the bottom. I'm a bit confused about the past being used as opposed to done but that's pretty much it. And yet the confirmation similar issue to earlier where I didn't really like the small thing and the lack of emphasis, but that's all good. And yeah, now I can see it's at a that's pretty good.
```

## Task Evaluation

The "Add New Flatmate" task showed a generally positive user interaction with clear pathways to accomplish the goal. However, there were notable issues with the final confirmation steps, where the 'plus' button was used instead of a more intuitive 'done' button, and the small size of the alert box made it difficult for users to easily interact with the yes/no buttons. These issues, although minor in the context of the entire task, could lead to frustration or errors during these final steps. The task transcription suggests that while the main navigational elements are clear, the details in the user interface that facilitate a seamless end-to-end experience require further attention to enhance overall usability and user satisfaction.
