# Test Design

The following document will outline the steps taken to improve the User Experience of our flat expense sharing app.

The following document will cover the following components:
* Design and Purpose
* Data Types and Collection
* Procedures and Key Tasks 
* Participants and Consent


## Data Types and Collection

### Quantitative
#### During the Test
When considering the types of data that can be collected, there are various factors that we would want to test:
* Time spent on Tasks
* User scanning patterns
* Moments of confusion

These would primarily focus on the functionality of the website. By identifying pain points, we can iterate on these findings to improve user experience.

If we were to use eyetracking, we should consider collecting the data and presenting them in the form of 

This research can produce three types of visualizations:

Gazeplots (qualitative)
Gaze replays (qualitative)
Heatmaps (quantitative)


#### Post Test Metrics
When we are looking at metrics-post test, we would ideally rely on using tried and true metrics such as the System Usability Scale or the Task Load index. This would allow us to compare our results against other usability standards to get perspective on how our app performs.

If we were to use the SUS method, it would provide a quick-quantitative measurement on the usability of the website. It would lean into its strengths of being widely applicable and requiring limited context to start up. However, if we were aiming to get more nuanced views on the experienece of our app, we will need an additional set of data collection measuers to meet that need.

## Qualitative
Here, we would be aiming to get a more nuanced view on the experience of our app. Due to the nature of how we are undergoing our testing. We should go forward with focus groups to get a 

Going back to the topic of eyetracking, we could consider the use of gazeplots, or replays for a qualitative visualisation of the user's experience.
